User Stories:

1. They say newer cars have less probability of injury in the event of an accident. I need a list of cars made after 2015 because I'm concerned with safety.
2. I'm a die hard Subaru fan, but I can't find any older models on their official website. I need to know which cars were made more than 15 years ago.
3. As a undergraduate college student with no income, I want a way to find a cheap car under $20,000, so I can drive to school.
4. As an environmental researcher not only does my career need me to travel but it has also made me aware of the dangers of carbon emissions. I would like a centralized source of vehicles that leaves a minimal amount of emissions.
5. I'm in the market for a car. More than just knowing the price, I want to know what the car will look like before I buy it.
