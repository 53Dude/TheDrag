*Interesting result produced by integrating disparate data sources: Being able to pull data from NHTSA, carmd, google, and more aided the team in regard to the topic of cars in the following ways: 

-Nearly every if not all automobiles are going to have the same attributes such as pictures, colors, MPG, pricing, VINS etc. Multiple sources for the same attributes will help give the use


*Tools Used: 
The Pit Crew (The development team behind TheDrag) utilized the following technical tools to complete Phase I:
Eclipse - The main IDE everyone used to code the Java, CSS, HTML, JSP, XML, etc. files and to run the website on the localhost through Google App Engine intergration.  
Google AppEngine - The PaaS used to host and take care of web protocol. Intergration with the IDE being used by all team members, Eclipse. 
Adobe DreamWeaver - The Front-End team used this visual to code editor for steamlined editing/development of Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML files. 
Bootstrap - The HTML, CSS, and JS library used by the Front-End team to achieve a polished-clean UI look. Found a specific design and implemnted into the website design. 
Maven - Used as our project builder and to quickly add third party libraries for us to use in our project
JSON Simple by Google - Used to encode the JSON file from CSV.
OKHTTP by Square - A request response API that allows us to collect data on our instances through making a request to other APIs.
Web Scraper by webscraper.io - A chrome extension that allows us to scrape data from websites easily. We can choose elements we want to  scrape and running the app allows us to download the scraped data as a CSV file which we can convert to a JSON file ourselves programmatically. We plan to only use this tool for Phase I, going forward we will program our own web scraper.
